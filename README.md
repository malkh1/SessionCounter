# SessionsCounter

Simple and Clean counter app I made that I use every single day

You can download the application by going to the Releases tab on the right side of Github, and downloading the SessionsCounter.jar

Once you download, you can run the file, and it should just work

The app saves to a log file when window is closed

At only a small 4 kB, the app is lightweight and does the job
